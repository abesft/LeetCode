# [167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)

Given an array of integers that is already **sorted in ascending order**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

**Note:**

- Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
- You may assume that each input would have *exactly* one solution and you may not use the *same* element twice.

**Example:**

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

-----

**题目**：在`1. Two Sum`的基础上添加新的条件：输入的`nums`是有序的。

**思路**：使用类似二分查找的思想。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right =  numbers.size() - 1;
        while(left < right)
        {
            if(numbers[left] + numbers[right] > target)
                --right;
            else if(numbers[left] + numbers[right] < target)
                ++left;
            else
                return vector<int>{left+1, right+1};
        }
        return vector<int>{};
    }
};
```
