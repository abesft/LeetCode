# [714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee/)

Your are given an array of integers `prices`, for which the `i`-th element is the price of a given stock on day `i`; and a non-negative integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.

You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction. You may not buy more than 1 share of a stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.)

Return the maximum profit you can make.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
Buying at prices[0] = 1
Selling at prices[3] = 8
Buying at prices[4] = 4
Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
```



**Note:**

- `0 < prices.length <= 50000`.

- `0 < prices[i] < 50000`.

- `0 <= fee < 50000`.

**题目**：股票交易最大利润，有交易费。

**思路**：同[309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown](https://blog.csdn.net/grllery/article/details/89738980)。分别对前`i`天最后一次交易状态(不一定是第`i`天)为买入和卖出进行考虑。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices, int fee) {
        int n = prices.size();
        if(n <= 1) return 0;
        int buy = -50000, pre_buy, sell = 0;
        for(auto price : prices){
            pre_buy = buy;
            buy = max(buy, sell - price);
            sell = max(sell, pre_buy + price - fee);
        }
        return sell;
    }
};
```
