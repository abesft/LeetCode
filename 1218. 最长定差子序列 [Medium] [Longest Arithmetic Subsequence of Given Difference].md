# [1218. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-subsequence-of-given-difference/)

Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `difference` , return the length of the longest subsequence in `arr` which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals `difference` .

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], difference = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [1,2,3,4].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,3,5,7], difference = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is any single element.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference = -2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [7,5,3,1].
```



**Constraints:**

* `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
* `-10^4 <= arr[i], difference <= 10^4`
