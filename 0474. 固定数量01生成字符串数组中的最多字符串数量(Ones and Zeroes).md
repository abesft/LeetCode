# [474. Ones and Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/ones-and-zeroes/)

In the computer world, use restricted resource you have to generate maximum benefit is what we always want to pursue.

For now, suppose you are a dominator of `m` 0s and `n` 1s respectively. On the other hand, there is an array with strings consisting of only 0s and 1s.

Now your task is to find the maximum number of strings that you can form with given `m` 0s and `n` 1s. Each 0 and 1 can be used at most once.

Note:
The given numbers of 0s and 1s will both not exceed 100
The size of given string array won't exceed 600.

Example 1:

    Input: Array = {"10", "0001", "111001", "1", "0"}, m = 5, n = 3
    Output: 4
    
    Explanation: This are totally 4 strings can be formed by the using of 5 0s and 3 1s, which are “10,”0001”,”1”,”0”

Example 2:

    Input: Array = {"10", "0", "1"}, m = 1, n = 1
    Output: 2
    
    Explanation: You could form "10", but then you'd have nothing left. Better form "0" and "1".

**题目**：给定`m`个`0`和`n`个`1`，判断能组成字符串数组中的最多字符串个数。

**思路**：参见[c++ DP solution with comments](https://leetcode.com/problems/ones-and-zeroes/discuss/95814/c%2B%2B-DP-solution-with-comments)。计算每个字符中0和1的个数，然后松弛`memo`。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxForm(vector<string>& strs, int m, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> memo(m+1, vector<int>(n+1));
        
        for(auto str : strs){
            int num_zeros = 0, num_ones = 0;
            for(auto c : str){
                if(c == '0')
                    ++num_zeros;
                else if(c == '1')
                    ++num_ones;
            }
            
            // 必须从右下往左上方向循环
            for(int i = m; i >= num_zeros; --i){
                for(int j = n; j >= num_ones; --j){
                    memo[i][j] = max(memo[i][j], memo[i-num_zeros][j-num_ones] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return memo[m][n];
    }
};
```
