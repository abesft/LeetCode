# [135. Candy](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/)

There are *N* children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

What is the minimum candies you must give?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
             The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

**题目**：分糖果问题。每个小朋友至少分到一个糖果，如果小朋友的得分比周围的小朋友的得分高，则糖果也要比他们多。问最小需要多少个糖果。

**思路**：参考[Approach 2: Using two arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/solution/)。从左往右扫一遍，从右往左扫一遍，取两个数组的较大值最为该位置上小朋友的糖果数。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {
        int n = ratings.size();
        if(n == 0) return 0;
        vector<int> left2right(n, 1);
        vector<int> right2left(n, 1);
        for(int i = 1; i < n; ++i){
            if(ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]){
                left2right[i] = left2right[i-1] + 1;
            }
        }

        for(int i = n-2; i >= 0; --i){
            if(ratings[i] > ratings[i+1]){
                right2left[i] = right2left[i+1] + 1;
            }
        }

        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
            res += max(left2right[i], right2left[i]);
        }

        return res;
    }
};
