# [920. Number of Music Playlists](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-music-playlists/)

Your music player contains `N` different songs and she wants to listen to `L` (not necessarily different) songs during your trip.  You create a playlist so that:

- Every song is played at least once
- A song can only be played again only if `K` other songs have been played

Return the number of possible playlists.  **As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7**.



**Example 1:**

```
Input: N = 3, L = 3, K = 1
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 possible playlists. [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: N = 2, L = 3, K = 0
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 possible playlists. [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: N = 2, L = 3, K = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 possible playlists. [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2]
```



**Note:**

1. `0 <= K < N <= L <= 100`

**题目**：

**思路**：`dp[i][j]`表示播放列表长度为`i`时，恰好包含`j`种不同的歌曲时对应的播放列表数。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numMusicPlaylists(int N, int L, int K) {
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        vector<vector<long>> dp(L+1, vector<long>(N+1));
        dp[0][0] = 1;

        for(int i = 1; i <= L; ++i){
            for(int j = 1; j <= min(i, N); ++j){
                // 选择未播放过的
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-1][j-1]*(N - j + 1)) % mod;
                // 选择播放过的
                if(j > K)
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-1][j] * (j - K)) % mod;
            }
        }

        return (int)dp[L][N];
    }
};
```
