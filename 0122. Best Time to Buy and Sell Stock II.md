# [122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/)

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4. Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int n = prices.size();
        if(n == 0) return 0;
        int profit = 0;
        int valley = prices[0], peak = prices[0];
        
        int i = 0;
        while(i < n - 1){
			while(i < n-1 && prices[i] >= prices[i+1]) // 波谷
                ++i;
            valley = prices[i];
            
            while(i < n-1 && prices[i] <= prices[i+1]) // 波峰
                ++i;
            peak = prices[i];
            
            profit += (peak - valley);
        }
        return profit;
    }
};
