# [202. Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/)

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

**Example:**

```
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        unordered_set<int> square;
        while(true){
            if(square.find(n) != square.end())
                break;
            square.insert(n);
            int square = 0;
            while(n){
                int remain = n % 10;
                square += remain * remain;
                n /= 10;
            }
            if(square == 1)
                return true;
            else
                n = square;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
