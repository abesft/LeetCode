# [787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops](https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/)

There are `n` cities connected by `m` flights. Each fight starts from city `u `and arrives at `v` with a price `w`.

Now given all the cities and flights, together with starting city `src` and the destination `dst`, your task is to find the cheapest price from `src` to `dst` with up to `k` stops. If there is no such route, output `-1`.

```
Example 1:
Input:
n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
Output: 200
Explanation:
The graph looks like this:


The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 1 stop costs 200, as marked red in the picture.
Example 2:
Input:
n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
Output: 500
Explanation:
The graph looks like this:

The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 0 stop costs 500, as marked blue in the picture.
```

**Note:**

- The number of nodes `n` will be in range `[1, 100]`, with nodes labeled from `0` to `n`` - 1`.
- The size of `flights` will be in range `[0, n * (n - 1) / 2]`.
- The format of each flight will be `(src, ``dst``, price)`.
- The price of each flight will be in the range `[1, 10000]`.
- `k` is in the range of `[0, n - 1]`.
- There will not be any duplicated flights or self cycles.

**题目**：由`src`最多经过`K`次中转到达`dst`的最小花费。

**思路**：最小堆。参考[Discuss](https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/discuss/115541/JavaPython-Priority-Queue-Solution)。用`Tuple`表示由`src`到达该点所需的花费，该位置的编号，以及剩余的最多中转次数。对于某一个`pos`，将与其相连的所有可能落点加入`pq`中。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findCheapestPrice(int n, vector<vector<int>>& flights, int src, int dst, int K) {
        vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> vec(n);
        for(auto f : flights)
            vec[f[0]].push_back({f[1], f[2]});

        priority_queue<Tuple, vector<Tuple>, Cmp> pq;
        pq.push({0, src, K+1});

        while(!pq.empty()){
            Tuple t = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            if(t.pos == dst)
                return t.cost;
            if(t.stops == 0)
                continue;
            for(auto f : vec[t.pos])
                pq.push({t.cost + f.second, f.first, t.stops-1});
        }

        return -1;
    }
private:
    struct Tuple{
        int cost;
        int pos;
        int stops;
        Tuple(int cost, int pos, int stops) : cost(cost), pos(pos), stops(stops){}
    };

    struct Cmp{
        bool operator()(Tuple& t1, Tuple& t2){
            return t1.cost > t2.cost;
        }
    };

};
