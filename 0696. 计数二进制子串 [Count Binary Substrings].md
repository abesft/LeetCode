# [696. Count Binary Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-binary-substrings/)

Give a string `s`, count the number of non-empty (contiguous) substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively.

Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "00110011"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".

Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.

Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "10101"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.
```

**Note:**

- `s.length` will be between 1 and 50,000.

- `s` will only consist of "0" or "1" characters.

**题目**：找出满足以下条件的连续子串：`0`的个数和`1`的个数相同且`0`和`1`在子串中均是分别成组的。

**思路**：参见[Group By Character](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-binary-substrings/solution/)。对于`0001111`其满足条件的子串分别为`000111`、`0011`、`01`等于`min(zeros, ones)`。因此首先将`s`中的`0`、`1`进行分组统计，如`s = "110001111000000"`，那么`groups = [2, 3, 4, 6]`.然后对于相邻的两组取较小值作为满足条件的子串的数目。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countBinarySubstrings(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        if(n < 2) return 0;
        vector<int> group(1, 1);
        
        for(int i=1; i<n; ++i){
            if(s[i] == s[i-1])
                ++group.back();
            else
                group.push_back(1);
        }
        
        int res = 0;
        for(int i=1; i<group.size(); ++i){
            res += min(group[i-1], group[i]);
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
