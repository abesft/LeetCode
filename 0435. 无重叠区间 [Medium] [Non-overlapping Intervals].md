# [435. Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)

Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

**Note:**

1. You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
2. Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.

 **Example 1:**

```
Input: [ [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3] ]

Output: 1

Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
```

 **Example 2:**

```
Input: [ [1,2], [1,2], [1,2] ]

Output: 2

Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.
```

 **Example 3:**

```
Input: [ [1,2], [2,3] ]

Output: 0

Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

**题目**：移除最少数量的`interval`使得`intervals`间不重叠。

**思路**：参考[Least is Most](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/discuss/91713/Java:-Least-is-Most)。求需移除的最少数量的`interval`，等价于求解最多的不重叠`interval`数量。对`intervals`按照`end`的坐标排序，下一个不重叠的`interval'`满足`interval'.start>=interval.end`。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int eraseOverlapIntervals(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        if(intervals.empty())
            return 0;
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), [](vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b){return a[1] < b[1];});
        int max_non_overlap = 1;
        int val = intervals[0][1];

        for(auto interval : intervals){
            if(interval[0] >= val){
                ++max_non_overlap;
                val = interval[1];
            }
        }

        return intervals.size() - max_non_overlap;
    }
};
```
