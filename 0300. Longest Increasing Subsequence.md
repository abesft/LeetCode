# [300. Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

**Example:**

    Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

**Note:**

- There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
- Your algorithm should run in O(n^2) complexity.

Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?

**题目**：最长递增子序列的长度。

**思路**：同[LeeCode673. Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://blog.csdn.net/grllery/article/details/89047128)。用`dp[i]`表示对于子串`nums[0...i]`最长的的递增子串的长度。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if(n <= 0) return 0;
        vector<int> dp(n, 1);
        int max_len = 1;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
            for(int j = 0; j < i; ++j){
                if(nums[j] < nums[i])
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
            }
            max_len = max(max_len, dp[i]);
        }
        return max_len;
    }
};
```
