# [1423. Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-points-you-can-obtain-from-cards/)

There are several cards **arranged in a row**, and each card has an associated number of points The points are given in the integer array `cardPoints`.

In one step, you can take one card from the beginning or from the end of the row. You have to take exactly `k` cards.

Your score is the sum of the points of the cards you have taken.

Given the integer array `cardPoints` and the integer `k`, return the *maximum score* you can obtain.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: cardPoints = [1,2,3,4,5,6,1], k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: After the first step, your score will always be 1. However, choosing the rightmost card first will maximize your total score. The optimal strategy is to take the three cards on the right, giving a final score of 1 + 6 + 5 = 12.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: cardPoints = [2,2,2], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Regardless of which two cards you take, your score will always be 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: cardPoints = [9,7,7,9,7,7,9], k = 7
Output: 55
Explanation: You have to take all the cards. Your score is the sum of points of all cards.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: cardPoints = [1,1000,1], k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: You cannot take the card in the middle. Your best score is 1.
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: cardPoints = [1,79,80,1,1,1,200,1], k = 3
Output: 202
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= cardPoints.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= cardPoints[i] <= 10^4`
- `1 <= k <= cardPoints.length`

-----

**题目**：从数组的两端（每次操作可从任意一端）取`k`个数，使得这`k`个数的和最大。

**思路**：滑窗，参考[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-points-you-can-obtain-from-cards/discuss/597763/Python3-Easy-Sliding-Window-O(n)%3A-Find-minimum-subarray)。要找到满足和最大的数组两端的`k`个数，则意味着剩下的`n-k`个数的和最小，且该`n-k`个数必然在数组中连续，因此以`n-k`的大小进行滑窗判断。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxScore(vector<int>& cardPoints, int k) {
        int n = cardPoints.size();
        int total = 0, min_score = INT_MAX;
        for(int i = 0, j = 0, cur = 0; j < n; ++j){
            cur += cardPoints[j];
            total += cardPoints[j];
            if(j - i + 1 > n - k)
                cur -= cardPoints[i++];
            // 注意两个if并列，不用else if，针对 n - k == 0 的情况
            if(j - i + 1 == n - k)
                min_score = min(min_score, cur);
        }
        return total - min_score;
    }
};
```
