# [881. Boats to Save People](https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/)

The `i`-th person has weight `people[i]`, and each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`.

Each boat carries at most 2 people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most `limit`.

Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.  (It is guaranteed each person can be carried by a boat.)

**Example 1:**

```
Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)
```

**Note**:

- `1 <= people.length <= 50000`
- `1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 30000`

-----

**题目**：最少数量的船渡河，其中每条船限制重量不能超过`limit`，同时每艘船最多载两个人。

**思路**：贪心算法，先按照人的重量排序，重量大的肯定要先上船，同时考虑是否能多增加一个重量轻的人，以此不断更新两端的指针。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numRescueBoats(vector<int>& people, int limit) {
        sort(people.begin(), people.end());
        int n = people.size();
        int l = 0, r = n-1;
        int res = 0;
        while(l <= r){
            if(people[r] + people[l] <= limit)
                ++l;
            --r;
            ++res;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
