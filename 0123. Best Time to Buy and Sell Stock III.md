# [123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/)

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most *two* transactions.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3. 
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4. Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, 
as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. 
You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

**题目**：股票交易最大利润，最多交易两次。

**思路**：<https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/discuss/39611/Is-it-Best-Solution-with-O(n)-O(1)./242914>。

> Similar to `Buy and Sell Stock I`, where only one transaction allowed, we keep track the lowest price and once the price exceeds the old lowest price, we record the difference.
>
> Here, the `oneBuy` keeps track of the lowest price, and `oneBuyOneSell` keeps track of the biggest profit we could get.
> Then the tricky part comes, how to handle the `twoBuy`? Suppose in real life, you have bought and sold a stock and made $100 dollar profit. When you want to purchase a stock which costs you $300 dollars, how would you think this? You must think, um, I have made $100 profit, so I think this $300 dollar stock is worth `$200` `FOR ME` since I have hold $100 for free.
> There we go, you got the idea how we calculate `twoBuy`!! We just minimize the cost again!! The `twoBuyTwoSell` is just making as much profit as possible.

            two_buy = min(two_buy, price - one_profit); // 第二次买入的花费除去第一次利润
            two_profit = max(two_profit, price - two_buy);

问题：最多交易`k`次。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:

        vector<int> buy(k, INT_MAX), profit(k+1, 0);

                buy[i] = min(buy[i], price - profit[i]);
                profit[i+1] = max(profit[i+1], price - buy[i]);
            }
