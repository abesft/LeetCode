# [973. K Closest Points to Origin](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/)

**[Medium]** We have a list of `points` on the plane. Find the `K` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)



**Example 1:**

```
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
(The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)
```



**Note:**

1. `1 <= K <= points.length <= 10000`
2. `-10000 < points[i][0] < 10000`
3. `-10000 < points[i][1] < 10000`

**题目**：离原点欧式距离最近的`K`个点。

**思路**：快排中的partition思路。（或者最小堆）。
