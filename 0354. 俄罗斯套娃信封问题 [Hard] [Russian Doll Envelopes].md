# [354. Russian Doll Envelopes](https://leetcode.com/problems/russian-doll-envelopes/)

You have a number of envelopes with widths and heights given as a pair of integers `(w, h)`. One envelope can fit into another if and only if both the width and height of one envelope is greater than the width and height of the other envelope.

What is the maximum number of envelopes can you Russian doll? (put one inside other)

**Note:**
Rotation is not allowed.

**Example:**

```
Input: [[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[2,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll is 3 ([2,3] => [5,4] => [6,7]).
```

**思路**：LIS，参考[Discuss](https://leetcode.com/problems/russian-doll-envelopes/discuss/82763/Java-NLogN-Solution-with-Explanation)。

> 1. Sort the array. Ascend on width and descend on height if width are same.
> 2. Find the [longest increasing subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/) based on height.
> 3. Since the width is increasing, we only need to consider height.
> 4. [3, 4] cannot contains [3, 3], so we need to put [3, 4] before [3, 3] when sorting otherwise it will be counted as an increasing number if the order is [3, 3], [3, 4]

private:
    static bool cmp(vector<int> a, vector<int> b){
        // 如果w相等，则将h大的排在前面，这样在计算LIS时，能够使得最小的h被选中
        if(a[0] == b[0])
            return a[1] > b[1];
        return a[0] < b[0];
