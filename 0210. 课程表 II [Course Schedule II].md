# [210. Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/)

There are a total of *n* courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.

There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2, [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished
             course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1] .
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both
             courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
             So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3] .
```

**Note:**

1. The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges**, not adjacency matrices. Read more about [how a graph is represented](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs).
2. You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

**题目**：课程有一定的先后关系，返回满足条件的课程安排。

**思路**：拓扑排序，参考[BFS](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/discuss/59317/Two-AC-solution-in-Java-using-BFS-and-DFS-with-explanation)和[Discuss](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/discuss/59316/C++-BFS-and-DFS)。先构建邻接表，计算每个结点的入度，将入度为0的结点加入队列中，同时更新该与结点对应的出度结点的入度数，这样就化简为了一个小的DAG有向无环图，重复以上步骤，直至队列为空，如果此时还有结点没被遍历到（存在环），说明找不到满足条件的答案。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findOrder(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        vector<vector<int>> g = buildGraph(numCourses, prerequisites);
        vector<int> indegree = getInDegree(g);
        queue<int> q;
        // 入度为0的结点加入队列
        for(int i = 0; i < indegree.size(); ++i){
            if(indegree[i] == 0)
                q.push(i);
        }

        int visited = 0;
        vector<int> res(numCourses);
        while(!q.empty()){
            int cur = q.front();
            q.pop();
            res[visited++] = cur;
            for(auto next : g[cur]){
                if(--indegree[next] == 0)
                    q.push(next);
            }
        }
        return visited == numCourses ? res : vector<int>{};
