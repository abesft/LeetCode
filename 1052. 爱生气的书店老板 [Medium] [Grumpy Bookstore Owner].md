# [1052. Grumpy Bookstore Owner](https://leetcode.com/problems/grumpy-bookstore-owner/)

Today, the bookstore owner has a store open for `customers.length` minutes.  Every minute, some number of customers (`customers[i]`) enter the store, and all those customers leave after the end of that minute.

On some minutes, the bookstore owner is grumpy.  If the bookstore owner is grumpy on the i-th minute, `grumpy[i] = 1`, otherwise `grumpy[i] = 0`.  When the bookstore owner is grumpy, the customers of that minute are not satisfied, otherwise they are satisfied.

The bookstore owner knows a secret technique to keep themselves not grumpy for `X` minutes straight, but can only use it once.

Return the maximum number of customers that can be satisfied throughout the day.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: customers = [1,0,1,2,1,1,7,5], grumpy = [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1], X = 3
Output: 16
Explanation: The bookstore owner keeps themselves not grumpy for the last 3 minutes.
The maximum number of customers that can be satisfied = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 + 5 = 16.
```

**Note:**

- `1 <= X <= customers.length == grumpy.length <= 20000`
- `0 <= customers[i] <= 1000`
- `0 <= grumpy[i] <= 1`

**题目**：爱生气的书店老板。`grumpy[i]=1`表示书店老板生气，此时顾客则不会满意。书店老板学到了一个超技能(●ˇ∀ˇ●)，能控制自己在连续的`X`分钟内不生气，但只能使用一次。求解最大的顾客满意数。

**思路**：参考[解析](https://leetcode.com/problems/grumpy-bookstore-owner/discuss/299237/C%2B%2B-Sliding-Window)。如果书店老板没有这个超能力，满意的顾客的数量`satisfied`是固定的，那我们可以通过滑窗的方式，计算`X`窗口内增加的满意顾客数量，记为`add_satisfied`，同时记下最大值`max_add_satisfied`。最后的结果为`satisfied + max_add_satisfied`。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSatisfied(vector<int>& customers, vector<int>& grumpy, int X) {
        int satisfied = 0, add_satisfied = 0, max_add_satisfied = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < customers.size(); ++i){
            satisfied += (1 - grumpy[i]) * customers[i];
            add_satisfied += grumpy[i] * customers[i];
            if(i >= X){
                add_satisfied -= grumpy[i-X] * customers[i-X];
            }
            max_add_satisfied = max(max_add_satisfied, add_satisfied);
        }
        return max_add_satisfied + satisfied;
    }
};
```
