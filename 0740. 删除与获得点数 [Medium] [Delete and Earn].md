# [740. Delete and Earn](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-and-earn/)

Given an array `nums` of integers, you can perform operations on the array.

In each operation, you pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. After, you must delete **every** element equal to `nums[i] - 1` or `nums[i] + 1` .

You start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3, 4, 2]
Output: 6
Explanation:
Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.
Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points. 6 total points are earned.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
Output: 9
Explanation:
Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2's and the 4.
Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.
9 total points are earned.
```

**Note:**

* The length of `nums` is at most `20000`.
* Each element `nums[i]` is an integer in the range `[1, 10000]`.

**题目**：给定一个整数数组 `nums` ，你可以对它进行一些操作。每次操作中，选择任意一个 `nums[i]` ，删除它并获得 `nums[i]` 的点数。之后，你必须删除**每个**等于 `nums[i] - 1` 或 `nums[i] + 1` 的元素。开始你拥有 0 个点数。返回你能通过这些操作获得的最大点数。

``` cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int deleteAndEarn(vector<int>& nums) {
        map<int, int> mp;
        for(auto num : nums)
            mp[num] += num;

        int prev2 = 0, prev1 = 0;
        for(auto item : mp){
            int tmp = prev1;
            if(mp.find(item.first-1) != mp.end())
                prev1 = max(prev1, prev2 + item.second);
            else
                prev1 += item.second;
            prev2 = tmp;
        }
        return prev1;
    }
};
