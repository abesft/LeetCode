# [236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

**Note:**

- All of the nodes' values will be unique.
- p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.

**题目**：二叉树的最近公共祖先。

**思路**：参考[Discuss](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/discuss/65225/4-lines-C%2B%2BJavaPythonRuby)。遍历查找，如果遇到结点`p`或者`q`则返回。当在左子树遇到目标结点时，查找当前右子树是否存在另一个目标结点。如果分布在左右子树上，那么根结点为最近的公共祖先；如果右子树始终找不到`q`，那么说明`p`是`q`的祖先结点。

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if(root == nullptr || root == p || root == q)
            return root;
        TreeNode* left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
        TreeNode* right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);
        if(left != nullptr && right != nullptr)
            return root;
        return left == nullptr ? right : left;
    }
};
