# [547. Friend Circles](https://leetcode.com/problems/friend-circles/)

There are **N** students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a **direct** friend of B, and B is a **direct** friend of C, then A is an **indirect** friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.

Given a **N\*N** matrix **M** representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are **direct** friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,0],
 [0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle. The 2nd student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,1],
 [0,1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, the 1st and 2nd students are direct friends, so the 0th and 2nd students are indirect friends. All of them are in the same friend circle, so return 1.
```

**Note:**

1. N is in range [1,200].
2. M[i][i] = 1 for all students.
3. If M[i][j] = 1, then M[j][i] = 1.

**题目**：班上有 N 名学生。其中有些人是朋友，有些则不是。他们的友谊具有是传递性。如果已知 A 是 B 的朋友，B 是 C 的朋友，那么我们可以认为 A 也是 C 的朋友。所谓的朋友圈，是指所有朋友的集合。给定一个 N * N 的矩阵 M，表示班级中学生之间的朋友关系。如果M[i][j] = 1，表示已知第 i 个和 j 个学生互为朋友关系，否则为不知道。你必须输出所有学生中的已知的朋友圈总数。

**思路**：参考[Discuss](https://leetcode.com/problems/friend-circles/discuss/101338/Neat-DFS-java-solution)。用`visit[i]`来记录是否遍历过第`i`个人对应的朋友圈。假设以第`i`个人作为起始点，那么遍历其和每个人的关系，如果`M[i][j]`为朋友关系，那么我们继续以第`j`个人为起点进行深搜，同时将第`j`个人标记为已经遍历过的。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findCircleNum(vector<vector<int>>& M) {
        int n = M.size();
        vector<bool> seen(n);
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
            if(seen[i] == false){
                dfs(M, seen, i);
                res += 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
private:
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& M, vector<bool>& seen, int i){
        if(seen[i]) return;
        seen[i] = true;
        int r = M.size();
        int c = r;
        for(int j = 0; j < c; ++j){
            if(M[i][j] == 1){
                dfs(M, seen, j);
            }
        }
        return;
    }
};
