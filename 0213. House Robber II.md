# [213. House Robber II](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/)

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle**. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

Example 1:

    Input: [2,3,2]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
                because they are adjacent houses.

Example 2:

    Input: [1,2,3,1]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
                Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

**题目**：求子序列的最大和，其中子序列元素在`nums`中的位置是不能相邻的。注意`nums[0]`和`nums[n-1]`相邻（环）。

**思路**：同[LeetCode198. House Robber](https://blog.csdn.net/grllery/article/details/88781077)。因为有环，拆成两种情况：从第一家开始到倒数第二家，排除最后一家；从第二家开始到最后一家，排除第一家。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if(n == 0) return 0;
        if(n == 1) return nums[0];

        return max(rob(nums, 0, n-2), rob(nums, 1, n-1));
    }
private:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums, int l, int r){
        if(l == r) return nums[l];
        int prev2 = nums[l];
        int prev1 = max(nums[l], nums[l+1]);

        for(int i = l+2; i <= r; ++i){
            int tmp = prev1;
            prev1 = max(nums[i] + prev2, prev1);
            prev2 = tmp;
        }

        return prev1;
    }
