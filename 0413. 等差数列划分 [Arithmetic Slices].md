# [413. Arithmetic Slices](https://leetcode.com/problems/arithmetic-slices/)

A sequence of number is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

For example, these are arithmetic sequence:

```
1, 3, 5, 7, 9
7, 7, 7, 7
3, -1, -5, -9
```

The following sequence is not arithmetic.

```
1, 1, 2, 5, 7
```

A zero-indexed array A consisting of N numbers is given. A slice of that array is any pair of integers (P, Q) such that 0 <= P < Q < N.

A slice (P, Q) of array A is called arithmetic if the sequence:
A[P], A[p + 1], ..., A[Q - 1], A[Q] is arithmetic. In particular, this means that P + 1 < Q.

The function should return the number of arithmetic slices in the array A.

**Example:**

```
A = [1, 2, 3, 4]

return: 3, for 3 arithmetic slices in A: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4] itself.
```

**题目**：等差数组的个数。

**思路**：参考[Discuss](https://leetcode.com/problems/arithmetic-slices/discuss/90058/Simple-Java-solution-9-lines-2ms)。用`cur`表示当前等差数组的有效长度，如对于`1 2 3 4`而言，`1 2 3`的有效长度为`1`，`1 2 3 4`的有效长度为`2`，表明当前子数组以`4`结尾的等差数列的个数为2，(2,3,4)和(1,2,3,4)。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfArithmeticSlices(vector<int>& A) {
        int n = A.size();
        int res = 0;
        int cur = 0;
        for(int i = 2; i < n; ++i){
            if(A[i-1] - A[i-2] == A[i] - A[i-1]){
                cur += 1;
                res += cur;
            }
            else
                cur = 0;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
