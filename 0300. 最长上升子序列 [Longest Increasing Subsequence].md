# [300. Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

**Example:**

```
Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 
```

**Note:**

- There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
- Your algorithm should run in O(*n2*) complexity.

**Follow up:** Could you improve it to O(*n* log *n*) time complexity?

**题目**：最长递增子序列的长度。

**思路**：同[LeeCode673. Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://blog.csdn.net/grllery/article/details/89047128)。用`dp[i]`表示对于子串`nums[0...i]`最长的的递增子串的长度。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if(n <= 0) return 0;
        vector<int> dp(n, 1);
        int max_len = 1;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
            for(int j = 0; j < i; ++j){
                if(nums[j] < nums[i])
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
            }
            max_len = max(max_len, dp[i]);
        }
        return max_len;
    }
};
```

**思路2**： 二分查找，时间复杂度可以降到`nlogn`，参见[Discuss](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/discuss/74824/JavaPython-Binary-search-O(nlogn)-time-with-explanation)。用`tail[i]`表示原数组`nums`中长度为`i+1`的递增子序列对应的最后一个元素。如`[1,3,5]`对应的`tail[0] = 1`,`tail[1] = 3`,`tail[2] = 5`。`tail`初始时没有任何元素，对于每个`num`，在`tail`的有效范围内查找首个大于等于`num`所在的位置，如果没有找到，说明LIS的大小可以增加1，扩大`tail`的有效范围；如果找到了，如`tails[i] >= num, tail[0..i-1] < num`，即表明对于长度为`i+1`的最长递增子序列，其尾元素是可以更新为更小的`num`。

> For length = 1, [1], [3], [5], [2], [8], [4], [6], we pick the one with smallest tail element as the representation of length=1, which is [1]
> For length = 2, [1,2] [1,3] [3,5] [2,8], ...., we pick [1,2] as the representation of length=2.
> Similarly, we can derive the sequence for length=3 and length=4
> The result sequence would be:
> len=1: [1]
> len=2: [1,2]
> len=3: [1,3,4]
> len=4: [1,3,5,6]

> According to the logic in the post,we can conclude that:
> (1) If there comes another element, 9
> We iterate all the sequences, found 9 is even greater than the tail of len=4 sequence, we then copy len=4 sequence to be a new sequece, and append 9 to the new sequence, which is len=5: [1,3,5,6,9]
> The result is:

> len=2: [1,2]

> (2) If there comes another 3,
> We found len=3 [1,3,4], whose tailer is just greater than 3, we update the len=3 sequence tobe [1,3,3]. The result is:

> 0 is smaller than the tail in len=1 sequence, so we update the len=1 sequence. The result is:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        vector<int> tails(n);
        int res = 0;
        for (auto num : nums) {
            int i = lower_bound(tails.begin(), tails.begin() + res, num) - tails.begin();
            tails[i] = num;
            if (i == res) ++res;
        }
        return res;
