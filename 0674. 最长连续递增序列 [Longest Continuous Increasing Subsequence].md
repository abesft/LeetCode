# [674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/)

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest `continuous` increasing subsequence (subarray).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3.
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1.
```

**Note:** Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.

**题目**：最长连续递增子数组的长度。

**思路**：每个连续递增子数组是不相交的。如果`nums[i-1] >= nums[i]`，说明找到了一个分界点。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findLengthOfLCIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        int res = 0, anchor = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i){
            if(i > 0 && nums[i-1] >= nums[i])
                anchor =  i;
            res = max(res, i - anchor + 1);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
