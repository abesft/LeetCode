# [1029. Two City Scheduling](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-city-scheduling/)

There are `2N` people a company is planning to interview. The cost of flying the `i`-th person to city `A` is `costs[i][0]`, and the cost of flying the `i`-th person to city `B` is `costs[i][1]`.

Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly `N` people arrive in each city.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
Output: 110
Explanation:
The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.

The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people interviewing in each city.
```

**Note:**

1. `1 <= costs.length <= 100`
2. It is guaranteed that `costs.length` is even.
3. `1 <= costs[i][0], costs[i][1] <= 1000`

**题目**：两地调度。`2N`个人，每个人去城市`A`和城市`B`的花费分别为`costs[i][0]`和`costs[i][1]`。计算使得`A`、`B`城市各有N个人所需的最小总花费。

**思路**：对于第`i`个人，计算其到城市`A`比到城市`B`能节省的费用`save[i]`，对`save`进行排序，取前面一半的去城市`A`，剩余的去城市`B`。

> let's say two person, `p0` and `p1`, if `p0[0] - p0[1] < p1[0] - p1[1]`, it equals to `p0[0] + p1[1] < p1[0] + p0[1]`, which means p0 to `A` and `p1` to `B` is cheaper than vice verse.

        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
            res += costs[i][0] + costs[i+n][1];
        }
