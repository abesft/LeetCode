# [1268. Search Suggestions System](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-suggestions-system/)

Given an array of strings `products` and a string `searchWord` . We want to design a system that suggests at most three product names from `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with the searchWord. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.

Return *list of lists* of the suggested `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWord = "mouse"
Output: [
["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
["mouse","mousepad"],
["mouse","mousepad"],
["mouse","mousepad"]
]
Explanation: products sorted lexicographically = ["mobile","moneypot","monitor","mouse","mousepad"]
After typing m and mo all products match and we show user ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"]
After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests ["mouse","mousepad"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "havana"
Output: [["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"]]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: products = ["bags","baggage","banner","box","cloths"], searchWord = "bags"
Output: [["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags"],["bags"]]
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "tatiana"
Output: [[],[],[],[],[],[],[]]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= products.length <= 1000`
* There are no repeated elements in `products`.
* `1 <= Σ products[i].length <= 2 * 10^4`
* All characters of `products[i]` are lower-case English letters.
* `1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000`
* All characters of `searchWord` are lower-case English letters.

**题目**：给你一个产品数组 `products` 和一个字符串 `searchWord` ， `products` 数组中每个产品都是一个字符串。请你设计一个推荐系统，在依次输入单词 `searchWord` 的每一个字母后，推荐 `products` 数组中前缀与 `searchWord` 相同的最多三个产品。如果前缀相同的可推荐产品超过三个，请按字典序返回最小的三个。请你以二维列表的形式，返回在输入 `searchWord` 每个字母后相应的推荐产品的列表。

**思路**：参考[lee215](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-suggestions-system/discuss/436674/C%2B%2BJavaPython-Sort-and-Binary-Search-the-Prefix)，对于排序后的字符串数组，如果 `a[i]` 是 `a[j]` 的前缀，那么 `a[i]` 也是 `a[i+1] a[i+2]....a[j]` 的前缀。

``` cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> suggestedProducts(vector<string>& products, string searchWord) {
        sort(products.begin(), products.end());
        vector<vector<string>> res;
        string cur = "";

        auto first = products.begin();
        for(auto c : searchWord){
            cur += c;
            auto iter = lower_bound(first, products.end(), cur);
            vector<string> v;
            for(int i = 0; i < 3 && iter + i != products.end(); ++i){
                string p = *(iter + i);
                if(p.find(cur) == std::string::npos)
                    break;
                v.push_back(p);
            }
            res.push_back(v);
            first = iter;
        }

        return res;
    }
};
