# [264. Ugly Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number-ii/)

Write a program to find the `n`-th ugly number.

Ugly numbers are **positive numbers** whose prime factors only include `2, 3, 5`.

**Example:**

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
```

**Note:**

1. `1` is typically treated as an ugly number.
2. `n` **does not exceed 1690**.

**题目**：第n个丑数。

**思路**：参考[C++ DP solution with short explanation](https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number-ii/discuss/69364/My-16ms-C%2B%2B-DP-solution-with-short-explanation).

> We have an array `k` of first n ugly number. We only know, at the beginning, the first one, which is 1. Then
>
> `k[1] = min( k[0]x2, k[0]x3, k[0]x5)`. The answer is `k[0]x2`. So we move 2's pointer to 1. Then we test:
>
> `k[2] = min( k[1]x2, k[0]x3, k[0]x5)`. And so on. Be careful about the cases such as 6, in which we need to forward both pointers of 2 and 3.

> x here is multiplication.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int nthUglyNumber(int n) {
        if(n <= 0) return 0;
        if(n == 1) return 1;
        vector<int> k(n);
        k[0] = 1;
        int t2 = 0, t3 = 0, t5 = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < n; ++i){
            k[i] = min(2*k[t2], min(3*k[t3], 5*k[t5]));
            if(2*k[t2] == k[i]) ++t2;
            if(3*k[t3] == k[i]) ++t3;
            if(5*k[t5] == k[i]) ++t5;
        }
        return k[n-1];
    }
};
