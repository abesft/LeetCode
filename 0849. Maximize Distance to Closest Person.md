# [849. Maximize Distance to Closest Person](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-distance-to-closest-person/)

In a row of seats, 1 represents a person sitting in that seat, and 0 represents that the seat is empty.

There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting.

Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized.

Return that maximum distance to closest person.

Example 1:

    Input: [1,0,0,0,1,0,1]
    Output: 2
    Explanation:
    If Alex sits in the second open seat (seats[2]), then the closest person has distance 2.
    If Alex sits in any other open seat, the closest person has distance 1.
    Thus, the maximum distance to the closest person is 2.

Example 2:

    Input: [1,0,0,0]
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    If Alex sits in the last seat, the closest person is 3 seats away.
    This is the maximum distance possible, so the answer is 3.

Note:

- 1 <= seats.length <= 20000
- seats contains only 0s or 1s, at least one 0, and at least one 1.

**题目**：一个由0和1组成的数组，1表示该位置上已经有人，0表示该位置上没人，在空位中找到距离最近的人的最大距离。

**思路**：参考[One pass, Easy Understood](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-distance-to-closest-person/discuss/137912/JavaC%2B%2BPython-One-pass-Easy-Understood)。题目的本质是查找最大的连续的0的长度，但是左边界和右边界需要特殊处理。

> Count the numbers of continuous zeros in the prefix, res = max(res, zeros)
> Count the numbers of continuous zeros in middle, res = max(res, (zeros + 1) / 2)
> Count the numbers of continuous zeros in the suffix, res = max(res, zeros)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDistToClosest(vector<int>& seats) {
        int n = seats.size();
        int i, j, res = 0;
        for(i = j = 0; j < n; ++j){
            if(seats[j] == 1){
                if(i == 0)
                    res = max(res, j);  //左边界的0
                else
                    res = max(res, (j - i + 1)/2);
                i = j + 1;
            }
        }
        res = max(res, n - i); //右边界的0

        return res;
    }
};
```
