# [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

**题目**：股票买卖的最大利润，最多只能交易一次。本质是计算数组中两个数的最大差值(右减左)。

**思路**：维护两个变量。遍历过的元素中的最小值`minval`，以及当前的最大差值`profit`。通过比较`num[i]-minval`和`profit`来不断更新`profit`。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int minval = INT_MAX;
        int profit = 0;
        for(auto price : prices){
            if(price < minval)
                minval = price;
            else if(price - minval > profit)
                profit = price - minval;
        }
        return profit;
    }
};
```
