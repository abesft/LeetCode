# [1334. Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-city-with-the-smallest-number-of-neighbors-at-a-threshold-distance/)

There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n-1`. Given the array `edges` where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti]` represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities `fromi` and `toi`, and given the integer `distanceThreshold`.

Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable through some path and whose distance is **at most** `distanceThreshold`, If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.

Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities ***i*** and ***j*** is equal to the sum of the edges' weights along that path.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[1,3,4],[2,3,1]], distanceThreshold = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph.
The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4 for each city are:
City 0 -> [City 1, City 2]
City 1 -> [City 0, City 2, City 3]
City 2 -> [City 0, City 1, City 3]
City 3 -> [City 1, City 2]
Cities 0 and 3 have 2 neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4, but we have to return city 3 since it has the greatest number.
```

**Example 2:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/16/find_the_city_02.png)**

```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,2],[0,4,8],[1,2,3],[1,4,2],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], distanceThreshold = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph.
The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 2 for each city are:
City 0 -> [City 1]
City 1 -> [City 0, City 4]
City 2 -> [City 3, City 4]
City 3 -> [City 2, City 4]
City 4 -> [City 1, City 2, City 3]
The city 0 has 1 neighboring city at a distanceThreshold = 2.
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
- `edges[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= fromi < toi < n`
- `1 <= weighti, distanceThreshold <= 10^4`
- All pairs `(fromi, toi)` are distinct.

-----

**题目**：有 `n` 个城市，按从 `0` 到 `n-1` 编号。给你一个边数组 `edges`，其中 `edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti]` 代表 `fromi` 和 `toi` 两个城市之间的双向加权边，距离阈值是一个整数 `distanceThreshold`。返回能通过某些路径到达其他城市数目最少、且路径距离 **最大** 为 `distanceThreshold` 的城市。如果有多个这样的城市，则返回编号最大的城市。

**思路**：计算点与点间的最短距离，采用Floyd算法。注意最外层循环为可能松弛的中间节点`k`。参考[lee215](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-city-with-the-smallest-number-of-neighbors-at-a-threshold-distance/discuss/490312/JavaC%2B%2BPython-Easy-Floyd-Algorithm).
