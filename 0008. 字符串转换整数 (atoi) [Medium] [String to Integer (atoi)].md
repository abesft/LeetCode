# [8. String to Integer (atoi)](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/)

Implement `atoi` which converts a string to an integer.

The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.

The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.

If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.

If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.

**Note**:

Only the space character ' ' is considered as whitespace character.
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (2^31 − 1) or INT_MIN (−2^31) is returned.

Example 1:

    Input: "42"
    Output: 42

Example 2:

    Input: "   -42"
    Output: -42
    Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign.
                Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.

Example 3:

    Input: "4193 with words"
    Output: 4193
    Explanation: Conversion stops at digit '3' as the next character is not a numerical digit.

Example 4:

    Input: "words and 987"
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is 'w', which is not a numerical
                digit or a +/- sign. Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.

**题目**：实现字符串转整型（atoi）。

**思路**：参考[simple solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/discuss/4654/My-simple-solution)。

考虑以下四种情况。

- 字符串前无意义的空格 (discards all leading whitespaces)
- 正负数 (sign of the number)
- 表示的数字是否溢出了INT类型的表示范围 (overflow)
- 非法的输入 (invalid input)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int myAtoi(string str) {
        int sign = 1, base = 0, i = 0;
        int len = str.size();

        //去除字符串前无意义的空格
        while(i < len && str[i] == ' ')
            ++i;

        if(str[i] == '-' || str[i] == '+')
            sign = str[i++] == '-' ? -1 : 1;

        while(i < len && str[i] >= '0' && str[i] <= '9'){
            //INT_MAX = 2^31-1 = 2147483647; INT_MIN (-2^31)
            if(base > INT_MAX / 10 || base == INT_MAX / 10 && str[i] - '0' > 7)
                return sign == 1 ? INT_MAX : INT_MIN;
            base = base * 10 + (str[i++] - '0');
        }
        return base * sign;
    }
};
```
