# [392. Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

Given a string `s` and a string `t`, check if `s` is subsequence of `t`.

You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both `s` and `t`. `t` is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and `s` is a short string (<=100).

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:

    s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"

    Return true.

Example 2:

    s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"

    Return false.

Follow up:

If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

**题目**：判断字符串`s`是否为字符串`t`的子序列。子序列表示`s`中的字符的相对位置不变。

**思路**：创建`t`的字符和索引map，对`s`中的每个字符取出其在map中的索引数组`vec`，用`prev`记录上一个匹配字符的下标索引，即在`vec`中找到的索引应大于`prev`。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        map<char, vector<int>> char_index;
        for(int i = 0; i < t.size(); ++i){
            char_index[t[i]].push_back(i);
        }

        int prev = -1;
        for(auto c : s){
            auto iter = char_index.find(c);
            if(iter == char_index.end())
                return false;
            auto vec = iter->second;
            auto pos = upper_bound(vec.begin(), vec.end(), prev);
            if(pos == vec.end())
                return false;
            prev = *pos;
        }

        return true;
    }
};
```
