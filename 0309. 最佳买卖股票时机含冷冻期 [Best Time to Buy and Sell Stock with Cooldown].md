# [309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/)

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

- You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
- After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)

**Example:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
```

**题目**：股票交易，卖出之后有一天的等待期。

**思路**：参见<https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/discuss/75927/Share-my-thinking-process>。对于每天总共有三种情况，买入卖出等待(观望)。假设前`i`天中最后一次交易后获得的最大的利润分别为`buy[i]`，`sell[i]`；其中`buy[i]`指的是在`0...i`天中最后一笔交易是买入，但不一定是在第`i`天买入，同理`sell[i]`。那么对于第`i`天，如果是等待或者买入`buy[i] = max(buy[i-1], sell[i-2] - prices[i])`；卖出或等待`sell[i] = max(sell[i-1], buy[i-1] + prices[i])`。空间复杂度可以优化到`O(1)`。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int n = prices.size();
        if(n <= 1) return 0;
        vector<int> sell(n), buy(n);
        // 初始状态
        buy[0] = -prices[0];
        buy[1] = max(buy[0], -prices[1]);
        sell[0] = 0;
        sell[1] = max(sell[0], buy[0] + prices[1]);

        for(int i = 2; i < n; ++i){
            buy[i] = max(buy[i-1], sell[i-2] - prices[i]);
            sell[i] = max(sell[i-1], buy[i-1] + prices[i]);
        }
        return sell[n-1];
    }
};
```



```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int n = prices.size();
        if(n <= 1) return 0;
        int sell = 0, pre_sell = 0, buy = INT_MIN, pre_buy;
        for(auto price : prices){
            pre_buy = buy;
            buy = max(buy, pre_sell - price);
            pre_sell = sell;
            sell = max(sell, pre_buy + price);
        }
        return sell;
    }
