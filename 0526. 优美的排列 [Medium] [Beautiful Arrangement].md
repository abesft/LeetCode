# [526. Beautiful Arrangement](https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-arrangement/)

Suppose you have **N** integers from 1 to N. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these **N** numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the ith position (1 <= i <= N) in this array:

1. The number at the ith position is divisible by **i**.
2. **i** is divisible by the number at the ith position.

 Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation:

The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).

The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.
```

 **Note:**

1. **N** is a positive integer and will not exceed 15.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countArrangement(int N) {
        int res = 0;
        vector<bool> used(N+1);
        helper(N, res, 1, used);
        return res;
    }
private:
    void helper(int N, int& res, int pos, vector<bool>& used){
        if(pos == N + 1){
            res += 1;
            return;
        }

        for(int i = 1; i <= N; ++i){
            if(!used[i] && (i % pos == 0 || pos % i == 0)){
                used[i] = true;
                helper(N, res, pos + 1, used);
                used[i] = false;
            }
        }
        return;
    }
