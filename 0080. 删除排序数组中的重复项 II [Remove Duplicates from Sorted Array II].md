# [80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/)

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:

    Given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

    Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.

    It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
Example 2:

    Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3],

    Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.

**题目**：删除排序数组中的重复项。每个元素最多允许出现两次。

**思路**：参见[分析](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/discuss/27976/3-6-easy-lines-C%2B%2B-Java-Python-Ruby)。

> Just go through the numbers and include those in the result that haven't been included twice already.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        int i = 0;
        for(auto item : nums)
            if(i < 2 || item > nums[i-2])
                nums[i++] = item;
        return i;
    }
};
```
