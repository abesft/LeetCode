# [1046. Last Stone Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight/)

We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose the two **heaviest** rocks and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`.  The result of this smash is:

- If `x == y`, both stones are totally destroyed;
- If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y-x`.

At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)



**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of last stone.
```



**Note:**

1. `1 <= stones.length <= 30`
2. `1 <= stones[i] <= 1000`

**题目**：有一堆的石头，每次合并最重的两个，合并后的石头重量为两个之差。返回最后剩下的石头重量。

**思路**：最大堆。参考[PriorityQueue](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight/discuss/294956/JavaPython-O(nlogn))。注意，为了代码的可读性，将合并后重量为0的石头仍加入priority_queue中。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lastStoneWeight(vector<int>& stones) {
        priority_queue<int> pq;
        for(auto stone : stones)
            pq.push(stone);

        for(int i = 0; i < stones.size()-1; ++i){
            int x = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            int y = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            pq.push(x - y);
        }

        return pq.top();
    }
};
```
