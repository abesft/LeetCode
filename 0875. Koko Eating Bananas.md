# [875. Koko Eating Bananas](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/)

Koko loves to eat bananas.  There are `N` piles of bananas, the i-th pile has `piles[i]` bananas.  The guards have gone and will come back in `H` hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `K`.  Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas, and eats `K` bananas from that pile.  If the pile has less than `K` bananas, she eats all of them instead, and won't eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly, but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards come back.

Return the minimum integer `K` such that she can eat all the bananas within `H` hours.

Example 1:

    Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], H = 8
    Output: 4

Example 2:

    Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], H = 5
    Output: 30

Example 3:

    Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], H = 6
    Output: 23

Note:

- 1 <= piles.length <= 10^4
- piles.length <= H <= 10^9
- 1 <= piles[i] <= 10^9

**题目**：Koko很喜欢吃香蕉。现在有n堆的香蕉，每堆香蕉的个数为`piles[i]`。假设koko吃香蕉的速度为`K`根/小时，如果某堆香蕉的个数小于`K`，在这一个小时内将不再吃别的香蕉。求在总共`H`小时内，koko的吃速至少为多少才能将所有香蕉吃完。

**思路**：二分法，同[1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days](https://blog.csdn.net/grllery/article/details/89683534)。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minEatingSpeed(vector<int>& piles, int H) {
        int left = 1, right = 1;
        for(auto banana : piles){
            right = max(right, banana);
        }

        while(left <= right){
            float speed = left + (right - left) / 2; // float数据类型
            int time = 0;
            for(auto banana : piles){
                time += ceil(banana / speed);
            }
            if(time > H)
                left = speed + 1;
            else
                right = speed - 1;
        }

        return left;
    }
};
```
