# [1208. Get Equal Substrings Within Budget](https://leetcode.com/problems/get-equal-substrings-within-budget/ )

You are given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length. You want to change `s` to `t`. Changing the `i`-th character of `s` to `i`-th character of `t` costs `|s[i] - t[i]|` that is, the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters.

You are also given an integer `maxCost`.

Return the maximum length of a substring of `s` that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of `t`with a cost less than or equal to `maxCost`.

If there is no substring from `s` that can be changed to its corresponding substring from `t`, return `0`.

 **Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: "abc" of s can change to "bcd". That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: Each character in s costs 2 to change to charactor in t, so the maximum length is 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: You can't make any change, so the maximum length is 1.
```

 **Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= maxCost <= 10^6`
- `s` and `t` only contain lower case English letters.

-----

**题目**：和小于`maxCost`的最长连续子数组。

**思路**：滑窗。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int equalSubstring(string s, string t, int maxCost) {
        int n = s.size();
        if(n == 0) return 0;

        vector<int> diff(n);

        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            diff[i] = abs(s[i] - t[i]);

        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int cur_sum = 0;
        int res = 0;

        while(j < n){
            cur_sum += diff[j];

            // 每次循环j总是右移一步
            // 因为当i右移时，如果j不移动，其长度比当前已知的res小
            j += 1;

            while(cur_sum > maxCost){
                cur_sum -= diff[i];
                i += 1;
            }

            res = max(res, j - i);
        }

        return res;
    }
};
